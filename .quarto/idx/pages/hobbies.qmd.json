This list is meant to be aspirational -- i.e. sort of Instagram take on my interests to motivate me to invest more time into things I like. Too often I find myself in a work-sleep-work cycle that leaves little time for enjoyment.\n\n### Gaming\n\nI have a PS5, a NS and a gaming PC. I play only single-player games, enjoy rouge-likes and open-worlds the most. My favorite games are [God of War (2018)](https://www.metacritic.com/game/god-of-war/), [Hades](https://www.metacritic.com/game/hades/) and [Trackmania](https://www.metacritic.com/game/trackmania/). If your life's companion is also a gamer (or just plays a little bit) i highly recommend [It Takes Two](https://www.metacritic.com/game/it-takes-two/).\n\n![](images/gaming.jpg){fig-align=\"center\" width=95% .lightbox}\n\n### Photography\n\nGot two cameras, old big hog [Canon 450D](https://www.photoreview.com.au/reviews/dslr-cameras/advanced/canon-eos-450d/) and compact and sleek [Sony A6000](https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/sony-alpha-a6000). I can make a decent portrait or Instagram 'location photo' but mosty interested in nature and urban settings. Would like to learn more on light and exposure usage, for now I am looking for contrasts and interesting compositions in my photos.\n\n![](images/photography.JPG){fig-align=\"center\" width=95% .lightbox}\n\n### History of science and mathematics\n\nClever ideas that fill and fuel natural sciences are often intimidating. Sure, there are occasional outliers -- genius individuals that make history with revolutionary inventions. But most of the progress is achieved by a tectonic creep of incremental small wins and observations. All of those geniuses stood on the shoulders of giants that came before. The history of how those ideas and meanders of knowledge happened can be thrilling and educating.\n\n![](images/maths.JPG){fig-align=\"center\" width=95% .lightbox}\n\n### Cooking\n\nMaster chef of making tasty meal from leftovers. Specializing in Asian fusion cuisine. Fried rice with pulled tofu? Sushi with beetroot? Korean beef with sauerkraut? Yes, those are all delicious!\n\n![](images/cooking.jpg){fig-align=\"center\" width=95% .lightbox}\n\n## Road cycling\n\nI am a proud owner of 90's vintage road bike. It was recently refurbished and looks smashing! It even has chipset print and binary code on the handles!\n\n![](images/road_bike.jpg){fig-align=\"center\" width=95% .lightbox}\n\n## Strolling.\n\nYes, just strolling, but with a philosophy. No headphones, no distractions, no direction. Just observing what changed in the neighborhood I've lived in for the last 15 years, and what is happening inside.
