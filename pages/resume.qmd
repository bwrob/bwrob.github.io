## Academic Experience

### [University of Wrocław](https://www.math.uni.wroc.pl/)

#### PhD Candidate \| Oct 2016 -- Jan 2019

Researched evolution equations involving non-local unbounded operators. Focused on applications of functional and harmonic analysis. Main 'hero' of my research was the [fractional Laplacian operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_Laplacian) --- jump-diffusion analogue of the classical Laplacian.

Also interested in hydrodynamic models and applications of PDEs in physics (porous medium modelling, flocking models, quantum mechanics).

*Unfinished.*

#### Junior Researcher \| Apr 2017 -- Jan 2019

Participated in the Polish National Science Center research grant [Nonlocal parabolic problems: regularity, blowup, pattern formation](https://projekty.ncn.gov.pl/en/index.php?projekt_id=352757). Principal Investigator Prof. [Piotr Biler](http://www.math.uni.wroc.pl/~biler/).

#### Teaching Assistant \| Mar 2017 -- Jul 2018
