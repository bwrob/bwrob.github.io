This blog is a battleground of sorts, but instead of swords and shields, we wield the weapons of Python and C++.
I'm a mathematician turned quantitative analyst turned software engineer.
Here, I'll document my coding conquests, from building practical and impractical tools, exploring financial concepts, to playing around with physics simulations.  
Expect a healthy dose of humor alongside the technical discussions. 
Let's be honest, even the most complex problems are more enjoyable with a sprinkle of laughter. 
So, grab a cup of coffee and join me on this exploration â€“ even if it's just for one interested reader!
