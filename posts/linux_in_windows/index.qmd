## Windows, Linux, and You: A Dynamic Duo

Tired of the age-old Windows vs. Linux debate among PC superusers?
Well, get ready to toss that outdated script out the window! 
I'll show you how to get the best of both world.

### Pros and cons 

Windows OS has long been the dominant platform for consumers and businesses alike.
It offers superior hardware compatibility and gaming experiences, 
However, Windows limitations in terms of system control and software development tools have been well-documented. 

Linux, on the other hand, has carved a niche for itself as the preferred operating system for developers and system administrators. 
Providing unparalleled flexibility and a vast array of open-source tools.
But the learning curve is steep, the open-source projects often get abbandoned, and with great power (sudo) comes great responsibility.

### Bridging the gap

At this point, even Microsoft, a strong contrarian to Linux in the past, embraced the usefulness of Linux shell at your fingertips.
Imagine having the sleek, user-friendly interface of Windows for your everyday tasks.
Combine it with a the raw power and flexibility of Linux for when you need to dive deep into development or system administration. 
And limited stakes once you (inevatibly) remove half of your file system with a bash script.
Enter Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL): a ticket to 10x-ing your Windows experience. 
Let's explore how this dynamic duo can supercharge your digital life.

###  WSL vs. Virtual Machines: What's the Difference?

You might be wondering how WSL differs from a traditional virtual machine (VM). 
While both provide a way to run Linux on Windows, they operate in fundamentally different ways. 
A VM essentially emulates a virtual computer within your computer, complete with its own operating system and hardware resources.
This makes VMs resource-intensive and can impact overall system performance. Â  
They are also hard to set up and maintain.

WSL, on the other hand, is a more lightweight approach. 
It integrates Linux directly into the Windows kernel, allowing for faster boot times, better performance, and seamless file sharing between Windows and Linux environments.
So, if you're looking for a powerful, efficient, and integrated way to harness the best of both Windows and Linux, WSL is the way to go.

## Installing and setuping WSL

First, we need to set up the WSL and install a chosen Linux distribution. 
Fortunatelly, this is super easy, bearly an inconvinience. 
You can choose from a list of distros pre-packaged by Microsoft, or download and build an image from scratch.
You can even build Arch and be legally alowed to say `BTW, I use Arch (on Windows)`.
Myself, I will go less involved route and choose Long Term Support version of Ubuntu.
Now, open the Powershell with administrative priviliges and run:

```{shell}
wsl --update
wsl --version
```

```{shell}
wsl -l -o
```

```{shell}
wsl --install -d 'Ubuntu-24.04'
```

Reboot the Windows system and you'll see `Ubuntu' among your applications.

## Base setup -- new shell and package manager

There is additional benefit we can reap with just a bit of more work - a fully system-agnostic setup.
By having Linux kernel run on Windows, we unified 2 out of 3 giants.
The only pillar that is missing is the Mac OS.
But wait, it's based on Unix as well! 
It just uses differrent default shell and lacks a package manager, as Apple doesn't trust it's clients.
Let's change the terminal shell to `zsh` in our Ubuntu installation and compile a secondary (to `apt-get`) package manager -- `brew`.

### Brewing starts

Install compilation utils first:
```{bash}
sudo apt-get upgrade -y
sudo apt-get install build-essential git -y
```

Execute the installation script for `brew`:
```{bash}
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Enable `brew` to be visible by your shell and check if it works:
```{bash}
eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
brew doctor
```
![](7.png)

Doctor's orders to append brew to some set of paths! Let's do this then:
```{bash}
echo 'export XDG_DATA_DIRS="/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/share:$XDG_DATA_DIRS"' >> ~/.profile
```

## Z-shell --- sea-shell

Now we can install `zsh`, it's trivial with `brew`:
```{bash}
brew install zsh
zsh --version
zsh
```

This will take you to interactive `.zshrc` file setup.
The file contains commands that are run each time a shell is spawned.
You can either generate empty file with `0` or go throug the interactive setup with `1`.

Check the default shell and set it to `zsh`:
```{bash}
echo $SHELL | sudo chsh -s $(which zsh) | echo $SHELL
```

Add the brew initialization to `.zshrc` file. 
The file contains commands that are run each time a shell is spawned.
This way `brew` will always be at your side!
```{bash}
(echo; echo 'eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"') >> /home/bwrob/.zshrc
```
