## Why a start up script?

Confession time. Pre-COVID I worked for a Swiss bank --- it was the whole corporate package. Working from a crowded office, open space, dedicated desks, dedicated desktop PCs, hundreds of people. And we never turned the PC's off, some of them were running constantly for months. Not very eco-friendly behavior, either from the company side and from the employees. But there were legit reasons for this and the company had much [bigger sins](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Credit_Suisse#Controversies) on their books.

As for the reasons for eternally turned on machines --- the proprietary frameworks and tooling we used were awfully heavy and slow. If you were occasionally forced to kill all the processes once in a while due to an update or system crash getting them all up again would take an hour or more. Developer tools, pricing systems, connections to Monte Carlo farms, downloading trade data, analysis definitions.

One tidbit to get this point across - in 2019 we still used 32-bit Win7, which had a cap on single-process memory consumption to 4Gb. We had a universally used hack to extend this to 8Gb for Excel, since the default wasn't enough for many of our pricing sheets.

When post-COVID I parted ways with the company, I got a corporate laptop from the new employer. The office was much sparser, quieter with 'hot seats' approach. I worked mostly remotely either way. This meant switching off the company machine each day, as the VPN connections and certificates wouldn't last overnight. I was extremally annoyed with opening all of the daily tools again and again, after getting used to having it all waiting for me to jump right in.

Hence the need for a startup script to open all of the apps, tools and files programatically. It won't cover everything, like authorizations or connections but still a little helper to start the day.

To spice things up, we will overengineer the hell out of it and use generic typing, generators and decorators :D.

## The startup script

### Public interface

Let's think about the design first, what we want to achieve. Imagine the code being split into two:

-   the hidden logic layer, the worker that does stuff,
-   and the public interface that integrates with the rest of the codebase or is called at the top level, the manager.

We can start by creating the public interface, see what we want to achieve, and later deal with filling in a working implementation. You can either define the logic functions as mocks, or just live with linting issues. This is what my desired usage is:

```{python}
#| eval: false

def run_startup_script():
    """
    Runs the startup script.
    """
    print(f"Welcome!")
    start_programs(
        [
            "powershell",
            "notepad++",
            ("firefox", 8),
        ]
    )
    start_work_files([".temp"])
    run_commands([('login-to-cloud --user bwrob', 30)])

```

We specify programs to be launched, open all files in a chosesn temp folder, and run a list of shell commands. After each step there should be some delay not to spam system with process calls. Certain steps might be more time consuming, like cloud services authorization. Those need longer delay. On the other hand, specifying delay for each task would be cumbersome, most cases would be fine with some default value. We end up with a design that our soon-to-be workers `start_programs`, `start_work_files`, and `run_commands` expect lists of either `task` or `(task, delay_seconds)`. We can now start the implementation by figuring out how the delay time should be defaulted if not specified.

### Decorator defaulting the time delays

```{python}
from functools import wraps
from typing import Callable, TypeVar

T = TypeVar("T")
TaskListOptionalDelay = list[tuple[T, int] | T]
TaskList = list[tuple[T, int]]


DEFAULT_DELAY_SECONDS = 4

def with_optional_delay(
    task_worker: Callable[[TaskList[T]], None],
) -> Callable[[TaskListOptionalDelay[T]], None]:
    """Adds default delay to all non-tuple items.

    Args:
        mixed_list: mixed list of items T or tuples (T, int) with delays
    """

    @wraps(task_worker)
    def task_defaulted_worker(task_list: TaskListOptionalDelay[T]) -> None:
        """A decorator that adds a default delay to tasks in a task list
        if no delay is specified.

        Args:
            task_list: A list of tasks with optional delays.
        """
        tasks_with_defaulted_delays: TaskList[T] = [
            item if isinstance(item, tuple) else (item, DEFAULT_DELAY_SECONDS)
            for item in task_list
        ]
        return task_worker(tasks_with_defaulted_delays)

    return task_defaulted_worker
```


### Main workers

```{python}
#| eval: false

from enum import Enum
from pathlib import Path


class Program(Enum):
    """Types of programs."""

    POWERSHELL = Path(r"C:\windows\system32\windowspowershell\v1.0\powershell.exe")
    NOTEPAD = Path(r"C:\Program Files\Notepad++\notepad++.exe")
    FIREFOX = Path(r"C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Firefox.lnk")



@with_optional_delay
def start_programs(
    programs: TaskList[Program],
) -> None:
    """Starts listed programs.

    Args:
        programs: List of programs to start.
            Can be a string or a tuple. If a tuple is given, the first
            element is the name, the second is the delay.
    """
    for program, delay in programs:
        start_process(
            name=program.name,
            path=program.value,
            delay=delay,
        )


@with_optional_delay
def start_work_files(
    directory_tasks: TaskList[Path],
) -> None:
    """Starts all  files in the work folders.

    Args:
        directory_tasks: List of tasks with paths to work folders.
    """
    for path, delay in path_files(directory_tasks):
        start_process(
            name=path.name,
            path=path,
            delay=delay,
        )


@with_optional_delay
def run_commands(
    commands: TaskList[str],
) -> None:
    """Runs all commands in the command list.

    Args:
        commands: List of commands to run.
    """
    for command, delay in commands:
        run_command(command, delay)

```


### List all files in list of directories

```{python}

def filter_excluded(
    path: Path,
) -> bool:
    """Filter path based on name and extension exclude lists.

    Args:
        path: Path to filter.
    """
    return (path.stem not in NAME_EXCLUDES) and (path.suffix not in EXT_EXCLUDES)


def path_files(
    directory_tasks: TaskList[Path],
) -> Generator[tuple[Path, int], None, None]:
    """Generates all files in the work folder that are not excluded.

    Yields the folder path at beginning of the generator.

    Args:
        temp_folder: Path to the work folder.
    """
    for folder, delay in directory_tasks:
        yield folder, delay

        all_files = folder.glob(FILES_IN_TREE_PATTERN)
        filtered = filter(filter_excluded, all_files)

        for file in filtered:
            yield file, delay


```

### Interacting with the OS

```{python}


def start_process(
    *,
    name: str,
    path: Path,
    delay: int = DEFAULT_DELAY_SECONDS,
) -> None:
    """Given a path, starts the target.

    Behavior:
        * Minimizes all windows.
        * Depending on the path target:
            * executable files are run,
            * content files are opened with system default program,
            * folders are opened with system explorer.

    Args:
        name: Name of the process to start.
        delay: Time to wait after starting the process.
    """
    if path.is_dir():
        print(f"Opening folder {name}")

    if path.suffix in (".exe", ".lnk"):
        print(f"Running app {name}")
    else:
        print(f"Opening file {name}")

    os.startfile(path)
    time.sleep(delay)


def run_command(
    command: str,
    delay: int,
) -> None:
    """Runs a powershell command.

    Args:
        command: Command to run.
    """
    _ = subprocess.call(
        f"powershell.exe {command}",
        shell=False,
    )
    time.sleep(delay)

```

## The last bit of convenience

We got it guys, the script works and the job is done. But.. do you recall the last time you googled a shortcut for a semi-frequently used functionality? Do you still remember the shortcut, or use it each time you need the functionality? Convinience needs to be convenient (obviously). So let' make usage of our script as seamless as possible.

At Windows OS, for me best way would be to have a shortcut that would run it on one click that is pinned to taskbar and start menu. To create one:

-   Go to any folder, right-click and select `New > Shortcut`.
-   In the guide that pops up paste in `%systemroot%\System32\cmd.exe /c "python.exe $1"` where `$1` should be replaced by the path to your script. You can also replace `python.exe` with interpreter path of any venv you wish.
-   Optionally, you can later change the icon for the shortcut (needs to be `.ico` file). I like to roll with Win-98 style \`My Computer' icon.
-   Copy the shortcut to start menu directory. For Win11 it's `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs`. You should be able to see it in start menu already. Now you can pin it to taskbar.

That's a good enough reminder and convenience tool for me. You might need some different setup, especially for another OS. For Linux, you might try to leverage `activate` or `bashrc` scripts in your working setup.

## Further extensions

There are a couple more things I wish this guy could do for me still:

-   **Changing Teams status to green** - there's a MS Graph API that could do this but we would need to manage Azure authorizations through the script. I am not up to that, especially on a work account. Might experiment on personal one in the future.
-   **Display placement of opened processes** -- I have 2 displays (which you could count as 4, due to size format) and I am very particular about where each app should go. I would love the apps to open where they should. This is however OS specific, for Win it require to mingle with win32api. Yet another project for the future.
