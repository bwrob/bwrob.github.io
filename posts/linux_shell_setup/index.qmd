## Oh my posh

Oh My Posh is a prompt theme engine for any shell, including Zsh. It allows you to customize your terminal prompt with themes and segments.

```{bash}
brew install jandedobbeleer/oh-my-posh/oh-my-posh
echo 'eval "$(oh-my-posh init zsh)"' >> .zshrc
echo 'OH_MY_POSH_THEME="kali"' >> .zshrc
```

## autosuggestions

Zsh autosuggestions provide command suggestions based on your history and current input, enhancing your command line experience.

```{bash}
brew install zsh-autosuggestions
# To activate the autosuggestions, add the following at the end of your .zshrc:
source $(brew --prefix)/share/zsh-autosuggestions/zsh-autosuggestions.zsh
```

## Aliases

Create a file `~/.bash_aliases` and add your aliases there, or directly in `.zshrc`.

```{bash}
# Alias definitions.
# You may want to put all your additions into a separate file like
# ~/.bash_aliases, instead of adding them here directly.
# See /usr/share/doc/bash-doc/examples in the bash-doc package.

if [ -f ~/.bash_aliases ]; then
    . ~/.bash_aliases
fi

alias zshconfig='nano ~/.zshrc'
alias ls='eza -la --group-directories-first --icons'
```

## Minor packages

### fzf

Fuzzy finder for command line, useful for searching files, history, etc.

```{bash}
brew install fzf
# Set up fzf key bindings and fuzzy completion
echo 'source <(fzf --zsh)' >> .zshrc
```

### eza

Better alternative to `ls` with icons and better defaults.
```{bash}
brew install eza
echo 'alias ls='eza -la --group-directories-first --icons'' >> .zshrc
```

### thefuck

A tool to correct mistyped commands in the terminal.

```{bash}
brew install thefuck
echo 'eval $(thefuck --alias)' >> .zshrc
```

### tmux

A terminal multiplexer that allows you to manage multiple terminal sessions from a single window.

```{bash}
brew install tmux
echo 'alias tmux="tmux -2"' >> .zshrc
```

### fastfetch

A tool to display system information in the terminal, similar to neofetch but faster.

```{bash}
brew install fastfetch
echo 'alias ff="fastfetch"' >> .zshrc
echo 'ff' >> .zshrc
```
